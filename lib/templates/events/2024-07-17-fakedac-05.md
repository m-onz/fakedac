# Event description

fake[dac~] is futuristic event with a cyber punk theme originally named after the digital to analog converter object within pure data so its pronounced: "fakedack".

fake[dac~] events showcase audio visual performers, visual artists VJ's, live coders from the algorave movement and fully immersive installations.

There has been a focus on algorithmic or procedurally generated content using real time software or commercial tools but fake[dac~] remains agnostic to technology.

The next fake[dac~] event at Corsica Studios in London will be pushing the boundaries with novel event concepts you can expect a culturally relevant fully immersive experience.
