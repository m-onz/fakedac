# Event description

Room 1:

fake[dac~] is an event dedicated to audio visual art, VJ'ing and visuals, live coding and algorave. The differentiator between this event and others is that its highly curated by m-onz and luis sanz (the co-founders) based on a paticular aesthetic and high standards.

We put the "rave" into algorave. Only the best visuals, cutting edge sounds, live coding, AV & installations pushing the envelope. This is not an art, noise or high brow event. Every artist is hand picked because they bridge the sometimes academic world of audio visuals and live coding with fun and engaging dance music. Those that explore algorithmic drum and bass and other typical club genre's are showcased.

fake[dac~] is fast paced and highly curated to create a club experience that is familiar but also has one foot in the future. We also feature an installation room to compliment the club experience.

Room 1:

hellocatfood

Antonio Roberts (aka hellocatfood) is a Birmingham-based musician and visual artist. Working primarily with TidalCycles, Pure Data and VCV Rack, he employs algorithmic methods to make music that is both rhythmic and glitchy. Since 2019 he has been building a reputation for his live performances, fusing genres ranging from ambient, footwork and IDM to drum and bass. He complements this with live visuals made using live coding software and hardware video synthesisers. He has performed across the UK and Europe at respected venues and festivals including Green Man, Barbican, No Bounds Festival, Tate Modern, Supernormal, Corsica Studios, Cafe Oto, and IKLECTIK. He is currently working on his debut EP to be released in 2025.

eye measure

Eye Measure is a UK-based experimental artist working primarily with algorithmic composition and creative coding. Their work has been described as "cavernous live-coded industrial ambience" and performed at places including at Cafe OTO, Corsica Studios + Iklectik.

ecolagbohrsac2021

ENGLAND'S COUNCIL OF LEGISLATION AND GOVERNING BODY OF HYPER REAL SIMULATIONS AND CONSTRUCTS [a.k.a ecolagbohrac2021] is a multimedia [installation, live A/V , quantum research, fashion, crypto & ai] powerhouse, conceptually focusing on mythic themes/folklore that populate the archetypal strata of the modern technological psyche, hypermedia and our understanding of reality.

+777000

+777000 is a computer musician and melodramatic coder. Currently working with post-Bangface approaches to rhythm and melody, pop samples, and vocal chops. They are 1/2 of Edited Arts – the London-based label and event series dedicated to club facing music with ambient aesthetics.

nunez

Visuals provided by nunez – a Spanish transdisciplinary designer exploring fields such as visual design, sound, creative coding, print or motion. They are currently utilising typography, coding and recordings to create new ways of communication for sonic and visual media.

nesso

Francesco Corvi is an Italian performer, musician, lecturer, and multimedia artist based in Berlin. His artistic practice explores new technologies through the development of unconventional performance strategies, including live coding and adaptive systems raising philosophical questions related to phenomenology, posthumanism, and cybernetics. In his live performances he employs open-source programming languages to create music and audiovisual shows at the intersection of computer music, electroacoustic music, new media art, post-IDM, and deconstructed club.

joana.art

Joana Chicau is a designer, researcher and coder, with a background in choreography and performance.

She researches the intersection of the body with the designed and programmed environment, aiming at widening the ways in which digital sciences is presented and made accessible to the public.

SYNTƏL8

connoisseur of deep sub bass, Daniel has exploded onto the scene this year with with maximum audio damage delivered via a custom audio softwarez.

luis sanz

Luis Sanz is a multidisciplinary artist working with synthetic sounds, computer graphics and physical audiovisual experiences. As an artist, Sanz develops installations that focus on the relationships between bodies and spaces, creating acoustic-imaginary dimensions that combine video, spatial sound, light and field recordings. As a musician, Sanz uses programming languages to develop rhythmic techniques and algorithmic processes of modulation and pattern generation in digital and analogue devices. His sonic works integrate noise, rhythms, processed field recordings and extreme computer music.

m-onz

is an audio visual artist and VJ exploring algorithmic art forms. With themes of procedural and generative 3D primitives. Hacking, scrolling code, re-processing and multi-genre music. He is co-founder of fake[dac~] an AV label and event brand.

Also featuring a live coding and visual debut from: xodyl x fridje x LXT.

Room 2:

An immersive audio visual installation from michael-jon mizra www dot mizra dot co dot uk built using super collider exploring generative processes.

Michael-Jon Mizra (b. 1991, Cape Town) is a computer musician based in London.

Whilst studying music at the University of Leeds (2009) he explored performativity in electronic music and was drawn to the radical implications of the laptop-as-instrument. This led to a career defining interest in how programmatic thinking, data-structure management, and algorithmic modelling can be used to compose and perform.

Working at the University of the Arts London as a specialist technician, researcher, and teacher of creative computation, he is an active member of the Live Code London scene, hosting monthly meetups where artists and researchers showcase their latest developments. His work has been performed and displayed at IKLECTIK, Corsica Studios, the London Design Museum, and the Manchester International Festival.
