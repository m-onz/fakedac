# Event description

fakedac events showcase the best new algorithmic music and visuals, projection mapping installations, VJ's and audio visual (AV) artists.

fakedac~ combines the bleeding edge audio visual performances with DJ sets and visuals to create an accessible, danceable and fun evening for all.

Expect bleeding edge multi genre algorithmic music and mesmorizing visuals that you can dance too. It is completely accessible and inclusive to anyone walking in off the street. Algorithmic music and visuals have hit the mainstream... you can be part of it.

## ruin theory

Ruin theory performs algorithmic music with Pure data (Pd) exploring rhythmic patterns and sonic textures. Visuals are generated from generative adversarial networks (GANs).

## ayankoko

Ayankoko uses syncopation, abnormal time signatures, and polyrhythms to explore new conceptual frameworks and create an overwhelming feeling of weightlessness.

## m-onz

m-onz created fakedac~ to give VJ's, AV artists and live coders more opportunities to perform. m-onz works primarily with Pd (Pure Data) and processing to create multi-genre algorithmic AV performances.

## south london bedroom orchestra (slbo)

south london bedroom orchestra (SLBO) aka Owain Jones from cigarette records performing a vinyl only DJ set switching between genres like garage, jungle and more.
