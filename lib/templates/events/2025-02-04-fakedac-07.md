# Event description

fake[dac~] is coming to birmingham.

fake[dac~] is an event dedicated to audio visual art, VJ'ing and visuals, live coding and algorave. The differentiator between this event and others is that its highly curated by m-onz and luis sanz (the co-founders) based on a paticular aesthetic and high standards.

We put the "rave" into algorave. Only the best visuals, cutting edge sounds, live coding, AV & installations pushing the envelope. This is not an art, noise or high brow event. Every artist is hand picked because they bridge the sometimes academic world of audio visuals and live coding with fun and engaging dance music. Those that explore algorithmic drum and bass and other typical club genre's are showcased.

fake[dac~] is fast paced and highly curated to create a club experience that is familiar but also has one foot in the future.

hellocatfood (AV Set)

Antonio Roberts (aka hellocatfood) is a Birmingham-based musician and visual artist. Working primarily with TidalCycles, Pure Data and VCV Rack, he employs algorithmic methods to make music that is both rhythmic and glitchy.

Since 2019 he has been building a reputation for his live performances, fusing genres ranging from ambient, footwork and IDM to drum and bass. He complements this with live visuals made using live coding software and hardware video synthesisers.

He has performed across the UK and Europe at respected venues and festivals including Green Man, Barbican, No Bounds Festival, Tate Modern, Supernormal, Corsica Studios, Cafe Oto, and IKLECTIK.

He is currently working on his debut EP to be released in 2025.

luis sanz

Luis Sanz is a multidisciplinary artist working with synthetic sounds, computer graphics and physical audiovisual experiences. As an artist, Sanz develops installations that focus on the relationships between bodies and spaces, creating acoustic-imaginary dimensions that combine video, spatial sound, light and field recordings. As a musician, Sanz uses programming languages to develop rhythmic techniques and algorithmic processes of modulation and pattern generation in digital and analogue devices. His sonic works integrate noise, rhythms, processed field recordings and extreme computer music. Sanz has co-founded fake[dac~], an algorithmic art platform based in London, and Amarus, an experimental music network based in Switzerland.

tyger blue

is an experimental musician from Birmingham, UK, specializing in electronic music and live coding. His eclectic catalog covers a blend of UK Bass, IDM, and Breaks. Tyger is dedicated to amplifying the contributions of Black musicians in electronic music, and his support on the (Algo|Afro) Futures programme reflects this commitment. He has performed at renowned venues and festivals, including No Bounds Festival, Vivid Projects, Corsica Studios, and IKLECTIK. His multimedia work has been featured at The Southbank Centre, and he continues to push the boundaries of live performance through the integration of open-source tools and virtual modular systems.

m-onz

is an audio visual artist and VJ exploring algorithmic art forms. With themes of procedural and generative 3D primitives. Hacking, scrolling code, re-processing and multi-genre music. He is co-founder of fake[dac~] an AV label and event brand.
